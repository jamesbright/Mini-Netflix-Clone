# Angular App Installation Guide

This guide will walk you through the installation process for setting up and running an Angular app. Please follow the steps below to get started.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the installation, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

- Node.js (version 12 or above)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- Angular CLI

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone <repository_url>
```

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using npm:

```
cd <project_directory>
npm install
```

This command will download and install all the necessary packages and libraries specified in the `package.json` file.

## Step 3: Serve the Application

To run the application locally, use the Angular CLI's `serve` command:

```
ng serve
```

After a successful build, you can access the application by visiting `http://localhost:4200` in your web browser.

## Step 4: Build the Application

If you want to build the application for production, you can use the following command:

```
ng build --prod
```

This command will generate a production-ready build of your application in the `dist/` directory.

## Additional Commands

Here are some additional commands that you might find useful:

- To run unit tests: `ng test`
- To run end-to-end tests: `ng e2e`
- To generate a new component: `ng generate component <component_name>`
- To generate a new service: `ng generate service <service_name>`

Please refer to the official Angular documentation for more information on these commands and other Angular-related topics.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully installed and set up the Angular app. Now you can start building and customizing your application according to your requirements.

If you have any questions or run into any issues, please consult the project documentation or reach out to the project maintainers for assistance.
